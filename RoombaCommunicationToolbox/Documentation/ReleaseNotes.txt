to-do

Version changes
---------------

v1.00b:31/03/2016
* Implementation of MATLAB objects, simplifying the communication and making it more reliable. Potietialy speeding it up.

v0.90: 09/03/2016
* Added a large amount of documentation (

v0.81: 05/12/2015
* Minor bug change, added # of bits in dec2bin (getSafetySensors). Maybe error will rise somewhere else ?
* Added battery check at startup. If <30%, warning.
* Added controlProgram_template with try-catch statement.
  This will automaticly stopRoomba(comPort) when error occurs

v0.80: 01/12/2015
* A lot of bugs were removed, wrong function to transform int to boolean was modified.
* function getDataUDP is now able to manipulate data so that str2byte receives correct form.
* All sensor functions are now working.

v0.75: 10/11/2015
* getOdometry now checks for velocity and radius if not given.
  CAUTION THIS IS x2 SLOWER !!!!
* Corrected bug with receved data string if python gives more then just numbers
  Now, data is trimmed until FIRST '[' and from last ']' to end.
* Try catch now indicates which function has failed.

v0.70: 01/10/2015
* Added startup guide in Documentation.

v0.6: 15/09/2015
* More appropriate user message for failure during UDP transition.
* getEncoders now clearly states it expects also the radius and the velocity of the Roomba.
* Added IP's of the 4 other Roomba's in case structure.

v0.50: 01/09/2015
* Adaptation of the original toolbox for data transition over UDP.
* Complete reprogramming of the getOdometry function. 
  Raw encoders values are now used, instead of in build-in function

Development notes & ToDo
------------------------

* Syntax difference between R2014 and R2013 on flip (flip(new) --> fliprl(old)). 
* Find improvements to debug EVEN with Try - catch statements.
* Explain how to make a new function with data sheet.
* speed up communication by giving more sensor data. e.g. add wall to safety sensors. Maybe even add dist and angle ?
* migration to python3
* !!!! strread for byte2str !!!!
* Use of streaming will largely speed up proces. Allready partialy implemented on bluetooth during summer 2015.
* Implementation of travelDist & turnAngle on the Pi ?
